\section*{Part 1}

To optimize the given MNIST model, I performed the following:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Added a Dense layer with 512 neurons
  \item To prevent overfitting, Dropout layer was added as well
  \item The algorithm was changed to `Adam'
  \item Number of epochs increased from 1 to 10
\end{itemize}

\section*{Part 2}

\subsection*{Part 2.1}

Initial model for Part 2 was using the same layers as the model for Part 1, which can be seen here \gh{14cec7c3}. The accuracy with that model was roughly 93\%.

\subsection*{Part 2.2}

To improve the model, I implemented a Convolution Neural Network, which increased the accuracy of notMNIST model to roughly 95\%.

\section*{Part 3}
